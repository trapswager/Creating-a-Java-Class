## Assignment Explanation

Hello! My name is Adel, and in this assignment, I created a Java class representing a chosen entity. The objective of this task is to learn how to define classes, use constructors, and implement methods in Java.

### Chosen Entity
I chose the **Book** class, as books hold significant importance in my life and can be interesting to many.

### Class Implementation
In the `Book` class, I defined the following attributes:
- `title` (the title of the book)
- `author` (the author of the book)
- `ISBN` (the ISBN number)
- `price` (the price of the book)

I created two constructors:
1. A parameterized constructor to initialize all the attributes.
2. A default constructor that initializes the attributes with default values.

I also implemented a `displayInfo` method that prints the book's information, along with an additional method that allows updating the book's price.

### Testing
In the `main` method, I created three objects of the `Book` class using both the parameterized and default constructors to demonstrate the class's functionality. I called the `displayInfo` method to display information about each book and tested the additional method.

This assignment helped me better understand the fundamentals of object-oriented programming in Java and the capabilities of working with classes.
